Assortment of Excellent Websites
--------------------------------

| [Apple.com](http://www.apple.com/) | Even if you don't love Apple computers, you have to love their design initiatives. The website mimics the look and feel of their new lines of products, and is easy to use and attractive to the eye, instantly capturing the attention of the user. |
| [Archinect.com](http://www.archinect.com/) | A trendy new-age architecture website with well chosen graphics and interactive features. |
| [CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/) | The #1 news site gets information across to its readers effectively with the help of many interactive features, constantly updated headlines, and other nifty additions such as online polls. |
| [Compaq.com](http://www.compaq.com/) | A fantastic company website that fulfills its purpose. Clear presentation, easy navigation, appropriate images, vibrant contrasting colors. |
| [Disney.com](http://www.disney.com/) | The home of magical Disney fun! This website cleverly mimics a theme park layout, and echoes the familiar Disney image with the use of cartoon-style graphics. Not the most technically impressive site, but it has a message and it is consistent with its chosen theme. |
| [Ikea.com](http://www.ikea.com/) | Makes an innovative use of Macromedia® Flash™ to showcase interior design and Ikea products. |
| [Java.Sun.com](http://java.sun.com/) | The home of Java® at Sun Microsystems. An attractive site that is minimilist despite appearing to use more advanced technologies. A masterful use of html to achieve a sophisticated look. Easy navigation and support for text-only browsers. |
| [Landor.com](http://www.landor.com/) | Another trendy company website that offers a simplistic and stylish design, easy navigation, and a clear statement of purpose on the homepage. Do however notice their use of some dubious images that don't really say much about the company or their products and services. |
| [MIT Foreign Languages & Literatures](http://web.mit.edu/fll/www/) | An excellent MIT site that demonstrates exactly how to continue a chosen metaphor throughout a website. This website also uses image maps very effectively without annoying the user. All images are relevant, and cleverly assembled. |
| [Nikewomen.com](https://www.nike.com/women) | An excellent use of the much-abused Macromedia® Flash™ technology to advertise products effectively in a highly interactive online catalogue. |
| [Sueellen.org](http://www.sueellen.org/) | A simple and elegant website that effectively showcases the work of a talented photographer and graphic designer. |
| [Travelocity.com](http://www.travelocity.com/) | This site speaks its message and has a clear theme - travel. Services are appropriately advertised and the travel theme is cleverly worked into highly functional and interactive webpages. |
| [Xbox.com](http://www.xbox.com/) | A wonderful site that showcases new Microsoft® gaming products. The navigation bars and graphics that enclose the pages cleverly mimic the design of the Xbox console - with the use of heat vents, and the familiar black and green plastic look. Helpful icons and banners notify visitors of new products. Pages are brief and uncluttered. 

Poor Web Design Examples
------------------------

| [Janet-Jackson.com](http://www.janetjackson.com/) | A typical example of a misuse of Macromedia® Flash™. Upon viewing this website ask yourself the following questions: What is the background supposed to be? Why is the window so small? What are the whirling polygons and sliding panels saying about Janet Jackson or her product? What is the little animated graphic in the top-right hand corner supposed to convey? If you are left unsure as to the answer of any of these questions, that is because the website has been designed to be glitzy, and at some point lost sight of its purpose. What is good about the site is the interactive sound features and actual audio and video content, but that's programming and musical talent, not web design. |
| [Nikelab.com](http://www.nikelab.com/) | A lot of effort was clearly put into this website, but why does the user need to see so many copies of the same images that stream up and down the screen as you move your mouse around? It is actually pretty hard to navigate this website, and even harder to discover the message behind nikelab.com, and what it is actually promoting, other than shoes. Text is far too small in places, and unnecessary information about loading modules is displayed to the user. In an attempt to appear futuristic, these features are more of an annoyance than anything else. |
| Zx26.com | This page serves absolutely no purpose except perhaps to display how the overuse of animated gifs can quickly turn your website very tacky.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| [Apache™](http://httpd.apache.org/) | The Apache™ HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX® and Windows® NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards. Apache™ has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April of 1996. The August 2002 Netcraft Web Server Survey found that 63% of the web sites on the Internet are using Apache™, thus making it more widely used than all other web servers combined. |
| [CGI](http://www.w3.org/CGI/) | The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard for interfacing external applications with information servers, such as HTTP or Web servers. A plain HTML document that the Web daemon retrieves is static, which means it exists in a constant state: a text file that doesn't change. A CGI program, on the other hand, is executed in real-time, so that it can output dynamic information. |
| [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) | Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a simple mechanism for adding style (e.g. fonts, colors, spacing) to Web documents. |
| DHTML | DHTML is the art of making HTML pages dynamic! |
| [Dreamweaver®](http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/) | The professional choice for building websites and Internet applications. |

| [JavaScript™](http://wp.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/3.0/handbook/javascript/) | JavaScript™ is a compact, object-based scripting language for developing client and server Internet applications. |
| [JSP™](http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/download.html) | JavaServer Pages (JSP™) technology offers a simple way to create dynamic Web pages that are both platform-independent and server-independent, giving you more freedom through Java®TM technology's "Write Once, Run AnywhereTM" capability. JSP™ technology separates content generation from presentation and takes advantage of reusable tags and objects, simplifying the maintenance of your Web applications. It's your choice -- JSP™ technology provides the scripting ability you need to create simple interactive Web pages, or it scales to support complex Web sites that are fully integrated with enterprise class applications. |
| [MySQL®](http://www.mysql.com/) | MySQL® is the world's most popular open source database, recognized for its speed and reliability. MySQL® AB, the company founded by the creators of the MySQL® database, provides MySQL® software development and related support and services. |
| [Perl](http://www.perl.com/) | Perl is a programming language which can be used for a large variety of tasks. A typical simple use of Perl would be for extracting information from a text file and printing out a report or for converting a text file into another form. But Perl provides a large number of tools for quite complicated problems, including systems programming. |

| [![Buy at MIT Press](/images/mp_logo.gif)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262025003) The MIT Guide to Teaching Web Site Design | Edward Barrett, Deborah A. Levinson, Suzana Lisanti | Most books on Web design focus on the appearance of the finished product and pay little attention to the ideas and processes involved in intelligent interactive design. This book is based on the premise that the principles that have defined good communication design in the past apply equally well to the Web. The basic process is one of defining the purpose, audience, and style appropriate to one's objectives. Another premise is that effective Web site design is an inherently collaborative process requiring not only technical skills but more traditional written and oral communication skills. Hence, this book stresses a social, process-oriented approach both to design and to classroom instruction. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} This book is written by Prof. Barrett himself and contains a lot of invaluable information for succeeding in the class. It even contains details of your assignments, and of his expectations for your projects! Worth looking at. |
